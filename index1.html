                </h3>
                <p align="justify"> When it comes to business devices, there are two leading contenders: the laptop and the tablet. 
                    Both have unique strengths and weaknesses, 
                    which can make them better or worse choices for your business. </p>
                <p align="justify"> The tablet is a mobile device that is larger than a smartphone and has a touchscreen interface. 
                    The laptop is a portable personal computer with a keyboard, LCD screen, and pointing device 
                    (usually a trackpad or mouse).</p>

                <p align="justify"><b>Difference between laptop and tablet:</b></p>

                </p>

                <p align="justify"> So, which device is better for your business? 
                    The answer to that question depends on what you need the device to do. If you need a device to create documents and presentations, 
                    then a laptop is the best option. However, if you need a mobile device that can be used for browsing the web, checking email, and taking notes,
                     then a tablet is your choice. Laptops are generally better for entertainment and light work tasks, while tablets are more suited for productivity tasks. 
                    </p>
                <p align="justify">Ultimately, the best device for your business depends on your individual needs.
